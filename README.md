The OTC (Over-the-Counter) market is a decentralized marketplace where
financial instruments are traded directly between parties, without the
involvement of a formal exchange. It operates through a network of
dealers and brokers who facilitate transactions between buyers and
sellers.\
\
**Here's a general overview of how the OTC market works:**\
\
**Participants:** The OTC market involves various participants,

individual traders. They can trade a wide range of financial instruments

the OTC market. They facilitate the buying and selling of financial
